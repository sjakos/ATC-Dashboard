# ATC-Dashboard
A basic display for a customer support team to show which Tier 2 team members are available as "Air Traffic Control" to help Tier 1 team members

This was a quick project to display a list of names in a browser window on a team dashboard monitor. 
Since the display was only hosted on a single computer and displayed on a TV along with call statistics I set up the static page in a local folder.
I used local storage to hold the ATC names so the team could update the available names without editing the HTML.
